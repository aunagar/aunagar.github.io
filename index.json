To enable a good prediction of the end of discharge of batteries, detailed electrochemical Li-I battery models have been developed. However, these battery models need to be calibrated regularly as the batteries degrade. In this paper, we implement a model-free Reinforcement Learning-based framework for reliably and efficiently inferring calibration parameters of battery models. The framework enables real-time inference of the battery degradation parameters in order to compensate the reality-gap from the observations. Most importantly, the proposed methodology does not need any labeled data samples, (samples of observations and the ground truth calibration parameters). Furthermore, to increase the stability of the parameter inference, we incorporate lyapunov energy decreasing condition as a regularizer for our policy network objective. Lyapunov regularizer enables that the inference tracking of the parameters converges to an optimal, no matter the initial condition. The experiments show impressive results compared to Kalman Filter-based approaches. Moreover, this framework is highly general and can be employed in calibration of other computational models.\n","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612137600,"objectID":"a0d861d1a2b535c57d4c58344f75f255","permalink":"https://aunagar.github.io/project/rlbattery/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rlbattery/","section":"project","summary":"Learning to calibrate battery models using lyapunov constrained actor-critic RL.

Traditional localization pipeline works in multiple phase: (a) retrieving nearest images from reference database (b) detecting and matching features, and (c) estimating pose from the matched features. In this project, we try to combine (b) and (c) and design algorithm for direct camera pose estimation for a query image given a (query, reference) pair. To design a direct localization algorithm, we use learned CNN features and optimize the pose for a query image to minimize the feature error between a query and a reference image pair.

However, the common assumption of having access to the complete training data may not always hold true. Instead, data could be provided by different sources at different points in time. Especially in the medical field, privacy regulations can exacerbate this problem by prohibiting storage of old data. In such scenarios, proper incremental training for DNNs becomes essential to not forget previously learned knowledge. To this end, a recently published method called Deep Model Consolidation (DMC) proposes knowledge distillation with auxiliary data. We use this method as a benchmark and propose improvements on top of it. Furthermore, we present a novel approach to transform auxiliary images to look more like images from old datasets. With experiments on known benchmark datasets as well as a dataset for tissue type classification, we show that DMC and our image transformer-based method can reduce forgetting of previously acquired knowledge.\n","date":1604102400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604102400,"objectID":"477074cdc00a1d89b54669def4dba4e6","permalink":"https://aunagar.github.io/project/clibm/","publishdate":"2020-10-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/clibm/","section":"project","summary":"Semester project with the Digital Pathology team at IBM Research, Zurich.
